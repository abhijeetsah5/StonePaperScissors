# StonePaperScissors

Developed an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to demonstrate fundamental web development skills. Implemented game logic, real-time user interaction, and dynamic UI updates to enhance user experience. The project helped strengthen understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design.
